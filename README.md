## 🎯 Microservice Pattern Decision Matrix — What, When, and Why to Use

Microservices are the backbone of modern backend systems. But designing them isn’t just about splitting your app into smaller parts -
you need solid design patterns to keep things scalable, reliable, and maintainable.

Monolithic architecture is simpler, but as your system grows, scalability, security, and reliability become real challenges. 
That’s where microservice design patterns shine — helping you build robust and maintainable systems.

I’ll walk you through the most essential Java microservice patterns, using Spring Boot and .properties config examples. 
Some real-world use cases, what, when, and why use case scenarios, will make it easy to understand and implement them in your projects.

# 1️⃣ Decomposition Pattern — Split by Business Capability
📖 Description:
Break down a monolithic application into independent services aligned with business domains.

📦 Example:

E-commerce domains like:

- OrderService
- PaymentService
- UserService
- +------------------+      +----------------+  +----------------+  +----------------+
- |   Monolith App   | ->   | Order Service   |  | Payment Service|  | User Service   |
- +--------+---------+     +----------------+  +----------------+  +----------------+

  
  
✅ Spring Boot Tip: Start each domain as a separate Spring Boot project with its own application.properties.

~ `When to use:`:

- You’re starting to break down a monolith
- You want clear domain separation (e.g., Order, User, Payment)
  
~  `Why:`

- Keeps each domain independent
- Aligns teams to business boundaries
- 📌 Pro tip: Start with 2–3 microservices before fully decomposing the app.

# 2️⃣ Database per Service Pattern
- 📖 Description:
- Each microservice should manage its own database to stay decoupled and independent.

- [Order Service]  ---> orders_db  
- [User Service]   ---> users_db  
- [Payment Service]---> payments_db
- ✅ Order Service — application.properties:
```java
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/orders_db
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=pass
```
- 📌 Avoid shared databases across services.

~ `When to use:`:

- Each service owns its data model
- Services must scale and deploy independently
  
~  `Why:`

- Prevents data coupling
- Enables scaling individual services
- ⚠️ Avoid shared DBs — they bring hidden dependencies.

# 3️⃣ API Gateway Pattern **(Mostly asked in Interviews)
- 📖 Description:
- A central entry point for all client requests. It handles routing, authentication, rate limiting, etc.

        +------------------+      +--------------+---------------------+
        |   API GATEWAY    | ->   |   Order Service  | Payment Service |
        +--------+---------+      +--------------+---------------------+
                 
✅ Gateway — application.properties:
```java
spring.application.name=api-gateway
server.port=8080
spring.cloud.gateway.routes[0].id=order-service
spring.cloud.gateway.routes[0].uri=http://localhost:8081
spring.cloud.gateway.routes[0].predicates=Path=/orders/**
spring.cloud.gateway.routes[1].id=payment-service
spring.cloud.gateway.routes[1].uri=http://localhost:8082
spring.cloud.gateway.routes[1].predicates=Path=/payments/**
```
~ `When to use:`:

- You need a single entry point for clients (UI, mobile, APIs)
- You want centralized routing, authentication, and throttling
  
~  `Why:`

- Simplifies client code
- Centralized cross-cutting concerns
- 📌 Choose Spring Cloud Gateway for Java-native support.

# 4️⃣ Service Discovery Pattern **(Mostly asked in Interviews)
- 📖 Description:
- Automatically register and discover services without hardcoding their locations.

      +-----------+       +--------------+
      |  Eureka   | <---->| OrderService |
      +-----------+       +--------------+
          ↑
       +---------------+
       | PaymentService|
       +---------------+
- ✅ Client — application.properties:
```java
spring.application.name=order-service
eureka.client.service-url.defaultZone=http://localhost:8761/eureka
```
✅ Server — application.properties:
```java
server.port=8761
eureka.client.register-with-eureka=false
eureka.client.fetch-registry=false
When to use:
```
- You deploy services dynamically (Docker, Kubernetes, ECS, etc.)
- IPs and ports change frequently
   ~  `Why:`

- Allows dynamic lookup and load balancing
- ✅ Pair this with Eureka or Kubernetes DNS for auto-registration.

# 5️⃣ Circuit Breaker Pattern **(Mostly asked in Interviews)
- 📖 Description:
- Prevents cascading failures by stopping repeated requests to a failed service.

      Order Service
        |
        v
      [Circuit Breaker]
        |
        v
      Payment Service

- ✅ Resilience4j — application.properties:
```java
resilience4j.circuitbreaker.instances.paymentService.register-health-indicator=true
resilience4j.circuitbreaker.instances.paymentService.sliding-window-size=5
resilience4j.circuitbreaker.instances.paymentService.failure-rate-threshold=50
```
~ `When to use:`:

- Services rely on other services
- Failures could cascade through the system
  
~  `Why:`

- Protects your system from overload
- Improves resilience and user experience
- 🚨 Use Resilience4j — it integrates easily with Spring Boot.

# 6️⃣ Externalized Configuration Pattern
- 📖 Description:
- Store configuration in a central place so that you can manage it outside the service code.

      +------------------+
      |  Config Server   |
      +--------+---------+
               |
      +-----------+---------+---------+
      | OrderService | PaymentService |
      +-----------+---------+---------+
- ✅ Client — application.properties:
```java
spring.application.name=order-service
spring.config.import=optional:configserver:http://localhost:8888
```
✅ Config Server — bootstrap.properties:
```java
server.port=8888
spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri=file:///home/shared-config
```
~ `When to use:`:

- You need to change the config without redeploying services
- You manage secrets, URLs, or feature flags
   ~  `Why:`

- Centralized management
- Environment-specific overrides
- 🔐 Store secrets securely (e.g., AWS Parameter Store, Vault).

# 7️⃣ Observability Pattern **(Mostly asked in Interviews)
- 📖 Description:
- Monitor logs, metrics, and traces to ensure service health and performance.

      +---------+       +-----------+       +---------+
      | Logs    |-----> | Logstash  |-----> | Kibana  |
      | Metrics |-----> | Prometheus|-----> | Grafana |
      | Traces  |-----> | Zipkin    |       |         |
      +---------+       +-----------+       +---------+
- ✅ application.properties:
```java
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*
management.endpoint.prometheus.enabled=true
management.metrics.export.prometheus.enabled=true
```
~ `When to use:`:

- You want to track what’s happening inside your services
- You need logs, metrics, and traces for debugging or alerting
   ~  `Why:`

- Helps in production troubleshooting
- Enables proactive monitoring
- 📊 Set up Prometheus + Grafana + Zipkin stack.

# 8️⃣ Asynchronous Messaging Pattern
- 📖 Description:
- Decouple services using message brokers like Kafka or RabbitMQ.

- OrderPlaced → [Kafka Topic: orders] → PaymentService
- ✅ Kafka Listener:
```java
@KafkaListener(topics = "order-topic", groupId = "payment-group")
public void consume(String message) {
    // handle order event
}
```
✅ Kafka — application.properties:
```java
spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers=localhost:9092
spring.kafka.consumer.group-id=payment-group
spring.kafka.consumer.auto-offset-reset=earliest
spring.kafka.consumer.key-deserializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer
spring.kafka.consumer.value-deserializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer
```
~ `When to use:`:

- You need to decouple services (e.g., event-driven flows)
- Some operations take time (e.g., payments, shipping)

 ~  `Why:`

- Improves scalability and fault tolerance
- 💬 Start with Kafka — great for event-driven architecture.

# 9️⃣ Security Pattern **(Mostly asked in Interviews)
- 📖 Description:
- Use OAuth2/JWT tokens to authenticate and authorize requests across services.

        [Client] → [Gateway] → [JWT Validation] → [Service]
- ✅ JWT — application.properties:
```java
spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.issuer-uri=https://your-auth.com/
spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.jwk-set-uri=https://your-auth.com/.well-known/jwks.json
```
~ `When to use:`:

- You expose services publicly or internally
- You want to control access and permissions

~  `Why:`

- Ensures secure communication
- Simplifies role-based access
- 🔐 Use Keycloak or Okta with Spring Security.

# 🔟 Saga Pattern (Distributed Transactions) **(Mostly asked in Interviews)
- 📖 Description:
- Use events or orchestration to manage transactions across multiple services.

- There are two approaches under the Saga Pattern.

- 🧠 Choreography
- Each service listens to events and acts accordingly.

- 🕹️ Orchestration
- A central service manages the transaction flow.

      Place Order → Deduct Payment → Ship Order
           |             |              |
         Event         Event          Event
- ✅ Tools:

- Kafka for Choreography
- Camunda/Temporal for Orchestration
~ `When to use:`:

- A business process involves multiple services
- You need to manage distributed transactions

~  `Why:`

- Maintains consistency across services
- Supports rollback and compensation flows
- 🔁 Use Kafka for choreography, or Camunda/Temporal for orchestration.

  # 🧱 Bulkhead Pattern
 - 📖 Description:
 - Isolate system failures by limiting resources for each service/component.

- ✅ Resilience4j — application.properties:
```java
resilience4j.bulkhead.instances.orderService.max-concurrent-calls=10
resilience4j.bulkhead.instances.orderService.max-wait-duration=500ms
```
~ `When to use:`:

- One slow service can block others
- You want to isolate failures

 ~  `Why:`

- Improves system stability
- Prevents resource exhaustion
- 🧱 Limit threads or DB pools per service.

  # 🌱 Strangler Fig Pattern
- 📖 Description:
- Migrate gradually from monolith to microservices using API Gateway routing.

      API Gateway
         ├── /orders → Microservice
         └── /admin  → Monolith
~ `When to use:`:

- You’re migrating a monolith to microservices
- You want a gradual migration without breaking existing systems

 ~  `Why:`

- Reduces risk during refactoring
- Enables service-by-service evolution
- 🌱 Route via API Gateway to new or legacy code.
